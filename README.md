# Tasty Taco App

## Installation

- Clone repo
- Run `bundle install`
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `rake db:create`, `rake db:migrate`, then `rake db:seed`

## Running

- Start the Rails server with `rails s`
- In a second terminal start the wepback-dev-server with `./bin/webpack-dev-server`
- Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Functionality

The app can support full CRUD functionalities in the Tacos, Ingredients, and Taco/Ingredient Category areas. As of right now, it can list the Tacos and Ingredients within the database. 

## Time Estimate

About 1 day (cumulative)

## Focus Area

I chose to focus mostly on the databases, models, and some controllers of the site,
with just a couple of views on the front-end, as those are the skills I felt were most important to display.

## Notes/Challenges/Areas of Improvement

This was a great learning experience and refresher for me. The entire process was a bit challenging, particularly figuring out the best schema design and relations in order to get the correct functionality for the site. However, I enjoyed getting into different tools I had never used before.
